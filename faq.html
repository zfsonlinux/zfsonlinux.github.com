<p>If you are using an Ubuntu distribution the easiest way to install ZFS is
with the <a href="https://launchpad.net/~zfs-native/+archive/stable">
ZFS PPA</a>.  Simply add the PPA to your list of repositories and install
the ubuntu-zfs packages with your favorite package manager.  The ZFS source will
be downloaded to your system and compiled with dkms.  In addition, the ZFS
source will be automatically recompiled when a new version is available
or when you update your kernel.</p>

<pre>
$ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:zfs-native/stable
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install ubuntu-zfs
</pre>

<p>If you are using a different Linux distribution you will have to manually
<a href="spl-building-rpm.html">download and compile the source</a> as
described in the documentation.</p>

<p>Note that because we want to take a cautious, careful approach with
ZFS on Linux we are still calling this a release candidate.  However, all
of the core functionality is in place and most of the advanced features
are working.  Stability of the latest release candidates has been very good
and performance is respectable.  Many people are successfully using the
ZFS on Linux release candidates every day.</p>

<p>Building a kernel module against an arbitrary kernel version is a
complicated thing to do.  Every Linux distribution has their own idea of
how this should be done.  It depends on the base kernel version, any
distribution specific patches, and exactly how the kernel was configured.
If you run in to problems here are few thing to check.  If none of these
things explain your problem, then please open a new

<p><b>You are strongly encouraged to use a 64-bit kernel.  At the moment zfs
will build in a 32-bit environment but will not run stably.</b></p>

<p>In the Solaris kernel it is common practice to make heavy use of the
virtual address space because it is designed to work well. However, in
the Linux kernel most memory is addressed with a physical address and use of
the virtual address space is strongly discouraged. This is particularly true
on 32-bit arches where the virtual address space is limited to roughly 100MiB
by default. Using the virtual address space on 64-bit Linux kernels is also
discouraged.  But in this case the address space is so much larger than
physical memory it is not as much of an issue.</p>

<p>If you are bumping up against the virtual memory limit you will see
the following message in your system logs.  You can increase the virtual address size
with the boot option <em>vmalloc=512M</em>.</p>

<table bgcolor=#eeeeee> <td> <pre>
vmap allocation for size 4198400 failed: use vmalloc=&lt;size&gt; to increase size.
</pre> </td> </table> <br>

However, even after making this change your system will likely not be
entirely stable.  Proper support for 32-bit systems is contingent upon the zfs code
being weaned off its dependence on virtual memory.  This will take some time to do
correctly but it is planned for the Linux port.  This change is also expected
to improve how efficiently zfs utilizes the systems memory.  And can be further
leveraged to allow tighter integration with the standard Linux VM mechanisms.

1.7 What /dev/ names should I use when creating my pool?</a>
		</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>
<p>There are different /dev/ names that can be used when creating a ZFS pool.
Each option has advantages and drawbacks, the right choice for your ZFS
pool really depends on your requirements.  For development and testing
using /dev/sdX naming is quick and easy.  A typical home server might
prefer /dev/disk/by-id/ naming for simplicity and readability.  While very
large configurations with multiple controllers, enclosures, and switches
will likely prefer /dev/disk/zpool naming for maximum control.  But in
the end, how you choose to identify your disks is up to you.</p>
<ul>
	<li>
<b>/dev/sdX, /dev/hdX:</b> Best for development/test pools
	</li>
	<ul>
		<li>
<em>Summary:</em>
The top level /dev/ names are the default for consistency with other ZFS
implementations.  They are available under all Linux distributions and are
commonly used.  However, because they are not persistent they should only
be used with ZFS for development/test pools.
		</li>
		<li>
<em>Benefits:</em>This method is easy for a quick test, the names are short,
and they will be available on all Linux distributions.
		</li>
		<li>
<em>Drawbacks:</em>The names are not persistent and will change depending on
what order they disks are detected in.  Adding or removing hardware for your
system can easily cause the names to change.  You would then need to remove
the zpool.cache file and re-import the pool using the new names.
		</li>
		<li>
<em>Example:</em>
<pre>$ sudo zpool create tank sda sdb</pre>
		</li>
	</ul><br>

	<li>
<b>/dev/disk/by-id/:</b> Best for small pools (less than 10 disks)
	</li>
	<ul>
		<li>
<em>Summary:</em>
This directory contains disk identifiers with more human readable names.
The disk identifier usually consists of the interface type, vendor name,
model number, device serial number, and partition number.  This approach
is more user friendly because it simplifies identifying a specific disk.
		</li>
		<li>
<em>Benefits:</em>
Nice for small systems with a single disk controller.  Because the names
are persistent and guaranteed not to change, it doesn't matter how the disks
are attached to the system.  You can take them all out, randomly mixed them
up on the desk, put them back anywhere in the system and your pool will still
be automatically imported correctly.
		</li>
		<li>
<em>Drawbacks:</em>
Configuring redundancy groups based on physical location becomes difficult
and error prone.
		</li>
		<li>
<em>Example:</em>
<pre>$ sudo zpool create tank scsi-SATA_Hitachi_HTS7220071201DP1D10DGG6HMRP</pre>
		</li>
	</ul><br>

	<li>
<b>/dev/disk/by-path/:</b> Good for large pools (greater than 10 disks)
	</li>
	<ul>
		<li>
<em>Summary:</em>
This approach is to use device names which include the physical cable layout
in the system, which means that a particular disk is tied to a specific
location.  The name describes the PCI bus number, as well as enclosure names
and port numbers.  This allows the most control when configuring a large pool.
		</li>
		<li>
<em>Benefits:</em>
Encoding the storage topology in the name is not only helpful for locating a
disk in large installations.  But it also allows you to explicitly layout your
redundancy groups over multiple adapters or enclosures.
		</li>
		<li>
<em>Drawbacks:</em>
These names are long, cumbersome, and difficult for a human to manage.
		</li>
		<li>
<em>Example:</em>
<pre>$ sudo zpool create tank pci-0000:00:1f.2-scsi-0:0:0:0 pci-0000:00:1f.2-scsi-1:0:0:0</pre>
		</li>
	</ul><br>

	<li>
<b>/dev/disk/zpool/:</b> Best for large pools (greater than 10 disks)
	</li>
	<ul>
		<li>
<em>Summary:</em>
This is essentially a variation of the /dev/disk/by-path/ method which allows
you to pick your own unique meaningful names for the disks.  These names will
be displayed by all the zfs utilities so it can be used to clarify the
administration of a large complex pool.
		</li>
		<li>
<em>Benefits:</em>
This approach has all the benefits of the /dev/disk/by-path/ method plus
it allows you to choose meaningful human readable names.
		</li>
		<li>
<em>Drawbacks:</em>
This method relies on having a /etc/zfs/zdev.conf file properly configured
for your system.   To configure this file please refer to section
<a href="#HowDoISetupZdevConf">1.9 How do I setup the /etc/zfs/zdev.conf file?</a>
		</li>
		<li>
<em>Example:</em>
<pre>$ sudo zpool create tank mirror A1 B1 mirror A2 B2</pre>

	<tr>
		<td>
<p>Changing the /dev/ names on an existing pool can be done by simply
exporting the pool and re-importing it with the -d option to specify
which new names should be used. For example, to use the custom names
in /dev/disk/zpool:</p>

<pre>
$ sudo zpool export tank
$ sudo zpool import -d /dev/disk/zpool tank

<p>In order to use /dev/disk/zpool/ naming the /etc/zfs/zdev.conf must be
configured.  This configuration file consists of custom meaningful names
which are mapped to a /dev/disk/by-path identifier.</p>

<p>For example, if you have a Sun X4550 and would like to setup mirror
pairs across controllers.  You can create a configuration file which
assigns the names A[0-7] to the disks on the first controller, and the
names B[0-7] to the disks on the second controller.

<p>After defining the new disk names run <em>udevadm trigger</em> to
prompt udev to parse the configuration file.  This will result in a new
/dev/disk/zpool directory which is populated with symlinks to /dev/sdX names.

	<tr>
		<td>
<p>To achieve good performance with your pool there are some easy best
practices you should follow.  Additionally, it should be made clear that
the ZFS on Linux implementation has not yet been optimized for performance.
As the project matures we can expect performance to improve.</p>

<ul>
	<li>
<b>Evenly balance your disk across controllers:</b>
Often the limiting factor for performance is not the disk but the controller.
By balancing your disks evenly across controllers you can often improve
throughput.
	</li>
	<li>
<b>Create your pool using whole disks:</b>
When running <em>zpool create</em> use whole disk names.  This will allow
ZFS to automatically partition the disk to ensure correct alignment.  It
will also improve interoperability with other ZFS implementations which
honor the <em>wholedisk</em> property.
	</li>
	<li>
<b>Have enough memory:</b>
A minimum of 2GB of memory is recommended for ZFS.  Additional memory is
strongly recommended when the compression and deduplication features are
enabled.
	</li>
	<li>
<b>Improve performance by setting ashift=12:</b>
You may be able to improve performance for some workloads by setting
ashift=12.  This tuning can only be set when the pool is first created
and it will result in a decrease of capacity.  For additional detail on why
you should set this option when using Advanced Format drives see section

<p>Whenever a pool is imported in the system it will be added to the
/etc/zfs/zpool.cache file.  This file stores pool configuration information
such as the vdev device names and the active pool state.  If this file
exists when the ZFS modules are loaded then any pool listed in the cache
file will be automatically imported.  When a pool is not listed in the
cache file it will need to be explicitly imported.

<p>ZFS has been integrated with the Linux NFS and SMB servers.  You
can share a ZFS file system by setting the <em>sharenfs</em> or
<em>sharesmb</em> file system property.  For example, to share the
file system tank/home via NFS and SMB with the default options.</p>

<pre>
$ sudo zfs set sharenfs=on tank/home
$ sudo zfs set sharesmb=on tank/home
</pre>

<p>Note you must still manually configure your network to allow NFS
of SMB.  You will also need to make sure that the NFS and SMB packages
for your distribution are installed.</p>

Yes, numerous people have had success with this.  However, because it
still requires the latest versions of grub and is distribution specific
we don't recommend it.  Instead we suggest using ZFS as your root file
system.  There are excellent walk through available for both

</ul>

<p>Note that the SELinux policy for ZFS on Linux is not yet implemented.
This can lead to issues such as the init script failing to auto-mount the
filesystems when SELinux is set to enforce.  The long term solution is to
add ZFS as a known filesystem type which supports xattrs to the default
SELinux policy.  This is something which must be done by the upstream
Linux distribution.  In the mean time, you can workaround this by setting
SELinux to permissive or disabled.</p>

<pre>
$ cat /etc/selinux/config
# This file controls the state of SELinux on the system.
# SELINUX= can take one of these three values:
#     enforcing - SELinux security policy is enforced.
#     permissive - SELinux prints warnings instead of enforcing.
#     disabled - No SELinux policy is loaded.
SELINUX=disabled
# SELINUXTYPE= can take one of these two values:
#     targeted - Targeted processes are protected,
#     mls - Multi Level Security protection.
SELINUXTYPE=targeted

<p>Advanced Format (AF) is a new disk format which natively uses a 4,096
byte instead of 512 byte sector size. To maintain compatibility with legacy
systems AF disks emulate a sector size of 512 bytes. By default, ZFS will
automatically detect the sector size of the drive. This combination will
result in poorly aligned disk access which will greatly degrade the pool
performance.</p>

Starting with version 0.6.0-rc5 an ashift property has been added to the
zpool command to explicitly assign the sector size of the created pool.
The ashift values range from 9 to 16 with the default value 0 meaning
auto-detect the sector size. This value is actually a bit shift value,
so an ashift value for 512 bytes is 9 (2<sup>9</sup> = 512) while the
ashift value for 4,096 bytes is 12 (2<sup>12</sup> = 4,096).  To force
the pool to use 4,096 byte sectors we must specify this at pool creation
time:</p>

<pre>$ sudo zpool create -o ashift=12 tank mirror sda sdb</pre>

1.16 Do I have to use ECC memory for ZFS?</a>
		</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>
<p>Using ECC memory for ZFS is strongly recommended for enterprise
environments where the strongest data integrity guarantees are required.
Without ECC memory rare random bit flips caused by cosmic rays or by
faulty memory can go undetected.  If this were to occur ZFS (or any
other filesystem) will write the damaged data to disk and be unable to
automatically detect the corruption.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, ECC memory is not always supported by consumer grade
hardware.  And even when it is ECC memory will be more expensive.  For
home users the additional safety brought by ECC memory might not justify
the cost.  It's up to you to determine what level of protection your
data requires.</p>

system is already low on memory.</p>
