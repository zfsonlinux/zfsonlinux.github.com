<p>Building a kernel module against an arbitrary kernel version is a
complicated thing to do.  Every Linux distribution has their own idea of
how this should be done.  It depends on the base kernel version, any
distribution specific patches, and exactly how the kernel was configured.
If you run in to problems here are few thing to check.  If none of these
things explain your problem, then please open a new

<p><b>You are strongly encouraged to use a 64-bit kernel.  At the moment zfs
will build in a 32-bit environment but will not run stably.</b></p>

<p>In the Solaris kernel it is common practice to make heavy use of the
virtual address space because it is designed to work well. However, in
the Linux kernel most memory is addressed with a physical address and use of
the virtual address space is strongly discouraged. This is particularly true
on 32-bit arches where the virtual address space is limited to roughly 100MiB
by default. Using the virtual address space on 64-bit Linux kernels is also
discouraged.  But in this case the address space is so much larger than
physical memory it is not as much of an issue.</p>

<p>If you are bumping up against the virtual memory limit you will see
the following message in your system logs.  You can increase the virtual address size
with the boot option <em>vmalloc=512M</em>.</p>

<table bgcolor=#eeeeee> <td> <pre>
vmap allocation for size 4198400 failed: use vmalloc=&lt;size&gt; to increase size.
</pre> </td> </table> <br>

However, even after making this change your system will likely not be
entirely stable.  Proper support for 32-bit systems is contingent upon the zfs code
being weaned off its dependence on virtual memory.  This will take some time to do
correctly but it is planned for the Linux port.  This change is also expected
to improve how efficiently zfs utilizes the systems memory.  And can be further
leveraged to allow tighter integration with the standard Linux VM mechanisms.

1.7 What /dev/ names should I use when creating my pool?</a>
		</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>
<p>There are different /dev/ names that can be used when creating a ZFS pool.
Each option has advantages and drawbacks, the right choice for your ZFS
pool really depends on your requirements.  For development and testing
using /dev/sdX naming is quick and easy.  A typical home server might
prefer /dev/disk/by-id/ naming for simplicity and readability.  While very
large configurations with multiple controllers, enclosures, and switches
will likely prefer /dev/disk/by-vdev naming for maximum control.  But in
the end, how you choose to identify your disks is up to you.</p>
<ul>
	<li>
<b>/dev/sdX, /dev/hdX:</b> Best for development/test pools
	</li>
	<ul>
		<li>
<em>Summary:</em>
The top level /dev/ names are the default for consistency with other ZFS
implementations.  They are available under all Linux distributions and are
commonly used.  However, because they are not persistent they should only
be used with ZFS for development/test pools.
		</li>
		<li>
<em>Benefits:</em>This method is easy for a quick test, the names are short,
and they will be available on all Linux distributions.
		</li>
		<li>
<em>Drawbacks:</em>The names are not persistent and will change depending on
what order they disks are detected in.  Adding or removing hardware for your
system can easily cause the names to change.  You would then need to remove
the zpool.cache file and re-import the pool using the new names.
		</li>
		<li>
<em>Example:</em>
<pre>$ sudo zpool create tank sda sdb</pre>
		</li>
	</ul><br>

	<li>
<b>/dev/disk/by-id/:</b> Best for small pools (less than 10 disks)
	</li>
	<ul>
		<li>
<em>Summary:</em>
This directory contains disk identifiers with more human readable names.
The disk identifier usually consists of the interface type, vendor name,
model number, device serial number, and partition number.  This approach
is more user friendly because it simplifies identifying a specific disk.
		</li>
		<li>
<em>Benefits:</em>
Nice for small systems with a single disk controller.  Because the names
are persistent and guaranteed not to change, it doesn't matter how the disks
are attached to the system.  You can take them all out, randomly mixed them
up on the desk, put them back anywhere in the system and your pool will still
be automatically imported correctly.
		</li>
		<li>
<em>Drawbacks:</em>
Configuring redundancy groups based on physical location becomes difficult
and error prone.
		</li>
		<li>
<em>Example:</em>
<pre>$ sudo zpool create tank scsi-SATA_Hitachi_HTS7220071201DP1D10DGG6HMRP</pre>
		</li>
	</ul><br>

	<li>
<b>/dev/disk/by-path/:</b> Good for large pools (greater than 10 disks)
	</li>
	<ul>
		<li>
<em>Summary:</em>
This approach is to use device names which include the physical cable layout
in the system, which means that a particular disk is tied to a specific
location.  The name describes the PCI bus number, as well as enclosure names
and port numbers.  This allows the most control when configuring a large pool.
		</li>
		<li>
<em>Benefits:</em>
Encoding the storage topology in the name is not only helpful for locating a
disk in large installations.  But it also allows you to explicitly layout your
redundancy groups over multiple adapters or enclosures.
		</li>
		<li>
<em>Drawbacks:</em>
These names are long, cumbersome, and difficult for a human to manage.
		</li>
		<li>
<em>Example:</em>
<pre>$ sudo zpool create tank pci-0000:00:1f.2-scsi-0:0:0:0 pci-0000:00:1f.2-scsi-1:0:0:0</pre>
		</li>
	</ul><br>

	<li>
<b>/dev/disk/by-vdev/:</b> Best for large pools (greater than 10 disks)
	</li>
	<ul>
		<li>
<em>Summary:</em>
This approach provides administrative control over device naming using
the configuration file /etc/zfs/vdev_id.conf.  Names for disks in JBODs
can be generated automatically to reflect their physical location by
enclosure IDs and slot numbers.  The names can also be manually assigned
based on existing udev device links, including those in
/dev/disk/by-path or /dev/disk/by-id.  This allows you to pick your own
unique meaningful names for the disks.  These names will be displayed by
all the zfs utilities so it can be used to clarify the administration of
a large complex pool. See the vdev_id and vdev_id.conf man pages for
further details.
		</li>
		<li>
<em>Benefits:</em>
The main benefit of this approach is that it allows you to choose
meaningful human-readable names. Beyond that, the benefits depend on the
naming method employed.  If the names are derived from the physical path
the benefits of /dev/disk/by-path are realized.  On the other hand,
aliasing the names based on drive identifiers or WWNs has the same
benefits as using /dev/disk/by-id.
		</li>
		<li>
<em>Drawbacks:</em>
This method relies on having a /etc/zfs/vdev_id.conf file properly configured
for your system.   To configure this file please refer to section
<a href="#HowDoISetupVdevIdConf">1.9 How do I setup the /etc/zfs/vdev_id.conf file?</a>
As with benefits, the drawbacks of /dev/disk/by-id or /dev/disk/by-path
may apply depending on the naming method employed.
		</li>
		<li>
<em>Example:</em>
<pre>$ sudo zpool create tank mirror A1 B1 mirror A2 B2</pre>

<p>Changing the /dev/ names on an existing pool can be done by simply
exporting the pool and re-importing it with the -d option to specify
which new names should be used. For example, to use the custom names

</pre>

<li>A SAS-switch topology.  Note that the channel keyword takes only
two arguments in this example.

<pre>
            topology      sas_switch

            channel 3            C
            channel 4            D
</pre>

<li>A multipath configuration.  Note that channel names have multiple
definitions - one per physical path.

<pre>
            multipath yes

            #       PCI_SLOT HBA PORT  CHANNEL NAME
            channel 85:00.0  1         A
            channel 85:00.0  0         B
            channel 86:00.0  1         A
            channel 86:00.0  0         B
</pre>

<li>A configuration using device link aliases.

<pre>
            #     by-vdev
            #     name     fully qualified or base name of device link
            alias d1       /dev/disk/by-id/wwn-0x5000c5002de3b9ca
            alias d2       wwn-0x5000c5002def789e
</pre>
</ul>


<p>After defining the new disk names run <em>udevadm trigger</em> to
prompt udev to parse the configuration file.  This will result in a new
/dev/disk/by-vdev directory which is populated with symlinks to /dev/sdX
names.  Following the first example above, you could then create the new
pool of mirrors with the following command:</p>

<pre>
$ sudo zpool create tank \
	mirror A0 B0 mirror A1 B1 mirror A2 B2 mirror A3 B3 \
	mirror A4 B4 mirror A5 B5 mirror A6 B6 mirror A7 B7

<p>To achieve good performance with your pool there are some easy best
practices you should follow.  Additionally, it should be made clear that
the ZFS on Linux implementation has not yet been optimized for performance.
As the project matures we can expect performance to improve.</p>

<ul>
	<li>
<b>Evenly balance your disk across controllers:</b>
Often the limiting factor for performance is not the disk but the controller.
By balancing your disks evenly across controllers you can often improve
throughput.
	</li>
	<li>
<b>Create your pool using whole disks:</b>
When running <em>zpool create</em> use whole disk names.  This will allow
ZFS to automatically partition the disk to ensure correct alignment.  It
will also improve interoperability with other ZFS implementations which
honor the <em>wholedisk</em> property.
	</li>
	<li>
<b>Have enough memory:</b>
A minimum of 2GB of memory is recommended for ZFS.  Additional memory is

<b>Improve performance by setting ashift=12:</b>
You may be able to improve performance for some workloads by setting
ashift=12.  This tuning can only be set when the pool is first created
and it will result in a decrease of capacity.  For additional detail on why
you should set this option when using Advanced Format drives see section

exists when the ZFS modules are loaded then any pool listed in the cache
file will be automatically imported.  When a pool is not listed in the

Yes, numerous people have had success with this.  However, because it

</ul>

<p>Note that the SELinux policy for ZFS on Linux is not yet implemented.
This can lead to issues such as the init script failing to auto-mount the
filesystems when SELinux is set to enforce.  The long term solution is to
add ZFS as a known filesystem type which supports xattrs to the default
SELinux policy.  This is something which must be done by the upstream
Linux distribution.  In the mean time, you can workaround this by setting
SELinux to permissive or disabled.</p>

<pre>
$ cat /etc/selinux/config
# This file controls the state of SELinux on the system.
# SELINUX= can take one of these three values:
#     enforcing - SELinux security policy is enforced.
#     permissive - SELinux prints warnings instead of enforcing.
#     disabled - No SELinux policy is loaded.
SELINUX=disabled
# SELINUXTYPE= can take one of these two values:
#     targeted - Targeted processes are protected,
#     mls - Multi Level Security protection.

<p>Advanced Format (AF) is a new disk format which natively uses a 4,096
byte instead of 512 byte sector size. To maintain compatibility with legacy
systems AF disks emulate a sector size of 512 bytes. By default, ZFS will
automatically detect the sector size of the drive. This combination will
result in poorly aligned disk access which will greatly degrade the pool
performance.</p>

Therefore the ability to set the ashift property has been added to
the zpool command.  This allows users to explicitly assign the sector
size at pool creation time.  The ashift values range from 9 to 16 with
the default value 0 meaning auto-detect the sector size.  This value is
actually a bit shift value, so an ashift value for 512 bytes is 9
(2<sup>9</sup> = 512) while the ashift value for 4,096 bytes is 12
(2<sup>12</sup> = 4,096).  To force the pool to use 4,096 byte sectors
we must specify this at pool creation time:</p>

<pre>$ sudo zpool create -o ashift=12 tank mirror sda sdb</pre>

1.16 Do I have to use ECC memory for ZFS?</a>
		</th>

	<tr>
		<td>
<p>Using ECC memory for ZFS is strongly recommended for enterprise
environments where the strongest data integrity guarantees are required.
Without ECC memory rare random bit flips caused by cosmic rays or by
faulty memory can go undetected.  If this were to occur ZFS (or any
other filesystem) will write the damaged data to disk and be unable to
automatically detect the corruption.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, ECC memory is not always supported by consumer grade
hardware.  And even when it is ECC memory will be more expensive.  For
home users the additional safety brought by ECC memory might not justify
the cost.  It's up to you to determine what level of protection your
data requires.</p>

<p>Sure, but it is usually recommended to keep virtual machine storage and hypervisor pools, quite separate.
Although few people have managed to successfully deploy and run ZFS on the same machine configured as Dom0.
There are few caveats:
	<ul>
		<li>Set a fair amount of memory in grub.conf, dedicated to Dom0. e.g. <pre>dom0_mem=16384M,max:16384M</pre></li>
		<li>Allocate no more of <em>30-40%</em> of Dom0's memory to ZFS in /etc/modprobe.d/zfs.conf. e.g. <pre>options zfs zfs_arc_max=6442450944</pre></li>
		<li>Disable Xen's auto-ballooning in <pre>/etc/xen/xl.conf</pre></li>
		<li>Watch out for any Xen bugs, such as <a href="http://lists.xen.org/archives/html/xen-devel/2012-12/msg01668.html" target="_blank">

restrictive licenses.  The combination of them causes problems because it
prevents using pieces of code exclusively available under one license with
pieces of code exclusively available under the other in the same binary.
In the case of the kernel, this prevents us from distributing ZFS as part
of the kernel binary. However, there is nothing in either license that
prevents distributing it in the form of a binary module or in the form
of source code.</p>
