<h4>For an active pool</h4>

<p>If this error was encountered while running 'zpool import', please see
the section below.  Otherwise, run 'zpool status -x' to determine which pool
has experienced a failure:</p>

<pre>
# zpool status -x
  pool: test
 state: FAULTED
status: One or more devices could not be opened.  There are insufficient
	replicas for the pool to continue functioning.
action: Attach the missing device and online it using 'zpool online'.
   see: http://www.sun.com/msg/ZFS-8000-3C
 scrub: none requested
config:

        NAME                  STATE     READ WRITE CKSUM
        test                  FAULTED      0     0     0  insufficient replicas
          c0t0d0              ONLINE       0     0     0
<font color='red'>          c0t0d1              FAULTED      0     0     0  cannot open</font>

errors: No known data errors
</pre>

<p>If the device has been temporarily detached from the system, attach the
device to the system and run 'zpool status' again.  The pool should
automatically detect the newly attached device and resume functioning.  You may
have to mount the filesystems in the pool explicitly using 'zfs
mount -a'.</p>

<p>If the device is no longer available and cannot be reattached to the
system, then the pool must be destroyed and re-created from a backup
source.</p>

<h4>For an exported pool</h4>

<p>If this error is encountered during a 'zpool import', it means that one
of the devices is not attached to the system:</p>

<pre>
# zpool import
  pool: test
    id: 10121266328238932306
 state: FAULTED
status: One or more devices are missing from the system.
action: The pool cannot be imported.  Attach the missing devices and
	try again.
   see: http://www.sun.com/msg/ZFS-8000-3C
config:

        test              FAULTED   insufficient replicas
          c0t0d0          ONLINE
<font color='red'>          c0t0d1          FAULTED   cannot open</font>
</pre>

<p>The pool cannot be imported until the missing device is attached to the
system.  If the device has been made available in an alternate location, use the
'-d' option to 'zpool import' to search for devices in a different directory.
If the missing device is unavailable, then the pool cannot be imported.<p>

	    device which was unable to be opened by the ZFS subsystem.
