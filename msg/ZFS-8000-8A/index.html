<dt><p><b>Type</b>
<dd>Error
<dt><p><b>Severity</b>
<dd>Critical
<dt><p><b>Description</b>
<dd>A file or directory could not be read due to corrupt data.
<dt><p><b>Automated Response</b>
<dd>No automated response will be taken.
<dt><p><b>Impact</b>
<dd>The file or directory is unavailable.
<dt><p><b>Suggested Action for System Administrator</b>
<dd>
<p>Run 'zpool status -x' to determine which pool is damaged:</p>

<pre>
# zpool status -x
  pool: test
 state: ONLINE
status: One or more devices has experienced an error and no valid replicas
        are available.  Some filesystem data is corrupt, and applications
        may have been affected.
action: Destroy the pool and restore from backup.
   see: https://zfsonlinux.com/msg/ZFS-8000-8A
 scrub: none requested
config:

        NAME                  STATE     READ WRITE CKSUM
        test                  ONLINE       0     0     2
          c0t0d0              ONLINE       0     0     2
          c0t0d1              ONLINE       0     0     0

errors: 1 data errors, use '-v' for a list
</pre>

<p>Unfortunately, the data cannot be repaired, and the only choice to
repair the data is to restore the pool from backup.  Applications attempting to
access the corrupted data will get an error (EIO), and data may be permanently
lost.</p>

<p>On recent versions of Solaris, the list of affected files can be
retrieved by using the '-v' option to 'zpool status':</p>

<pre>
# zpool status -xv
  pool: test
 state: ONLINE
status: One or more devices has experienced an error and no valid replicas
        are available.  Some filesystem data is corrupt, and applications
        may have been affected.
action: Destroy the pool and restore from backup.
   see: https://zfsonlinux.com/msg/ZFS-8000-8A
 scrub: none requested
config:

        NAME                  STATE     READ WRITE CKSUM
        test                  ONLINE       0     0     2
          c0t0d0              ONLINE       0     0     2
          c0t0d1              ONLINE       0     0     0

errors: Permanent errors have been detected in the following files:

        /export/example/foo
</pre>

<p>Damaged files may or may not be able to be removed depending on the
type of corruption.  If the corruption is within the plain data, the file should
be removable.  If the corruption is in the file metadata, then the file cannot
be removed, though it can be moved to an alternate location.  In either case,
the data should be restored from a backup source.  It is also possible for the
corruption to be within pool-wide metadata, resulting in entire datasets being
unavailable.  If this is the case, the only option is to destroy the pool and
re-create the datasets from backup.</p>
