<dd>
The pool contains an on-disk format incompatibility.  Affected pools must be
imported and scrubbed using the current version of ZFS.  This will return the
pool to a state in which it may be imported by other implementations.  This
errata only impacts compatibility between ZFS versions, no user data is at
risk as result of this erratum.

<pre>
# zpool status -x
  pool: test
 state: ONLINE
status: Errata #1 detected.
action: To correct the issue run 'zpool scrub'.

<dd>Compatibility
<dt><p><b>Severity</b>
<dd>Moderate
<dt><p><b>Description</b>
<dd>The ZFS packages were updated while an asynchronous destroy was in
progress and the pool contains an on-disk format incompatibility.
<dt><p><b>Automated Response</b>
<dd>No automated response will be taken.

<dd>The pool cannot be imported until the issue is corrected.
<dt><p><b>Suggested Action for System Administrator</b>
<dd>
Affected pools must be reverted to the previous ZFS version where they can
be correctly imported.  Once imported all asynchronous destroy operations
must be allowed to complete.  The ZFS packages may then be updated and the
pool can be imported cleanly by the newer software.
<pre>
# zpool import
  pool: test
    id: 1165955789558693437
 state: ONLINE
status: Errata #2 detected.
action: The pool cannot be imported with this version of ZFS due to
	an active asynchronous destroy.  Revert to an earlier version
	and allow the destroy to complete before updating.
   see: http://zfsonlinux.org/msg/ZFS-8000-ER
config:

	test           ONLINE
	  raidz1-0     ONLINE

	    vdev1      ONLINE
	    vdev2      ONLINE
	    vdev3      ONLINE
</pre>

Revert to previous ZFS version, import the pool, then wait for the
<b>freeing</b> property to drop to zero.  This indicates that all outstanding
asynchronous destroys have completed.

<pre>
# zpool get freeing
NAME  PROPERTY  VALUE    SOURCE
test  freeing   0        default
</pre>

The ZFS packages may be now be updated and the pool imported.  The on-disk
format incompatibility can now be corrected online as described in
<a href="#1">Errata #1</a>.

<p>
<dl>
<dt><p><b>Type</b>
<dd>Compatibility
<dt><p><b>Severity</b>
<dd>Moderate
<dt><p><b>Description</b>
<dd>An encrypted dataset contains an on-disk format incompatability.
<dt><p><b>Automated Response</b>
<dd>No automated response will be taken.
<dt><p><b>Impact</b>
<dd>
Encrypted datasets created before the ZFS packages were updated cannot be
mounted or opened for write. The errata impacts the ability of ZFS to correctly
perform raw sends, so this functionality has been disabled for these datasets.
</dd>
<dt><p><b>Suggested Action for System Administrator</b>
<dd>
System administrators with affected pools will need to recreate any encrypted
datasets created before the new version of ZFS was used. This can be
accomplished by using <b>zfs send</b> and <b>zfs receive</b>. Note, however,
that backups can NOT be done with a raw <b>zfs send -w</b>, since this would
preserve the on-disk incompatibility. Since the <b>-p</b> and <b>-R</b> options
imply <b>-w</b> for encrypted datasets, these flags can not be used either.
Alternatively, system administrators can use conventional tools to back up data
to new encrypted datasets. The new version of ZFS will prevent new data from
being written to the impacted datasets, but they can still be mounted read-only.
<pre>
# zpool status
  pool: test
    id: 1165955789558693437
 state: ONLINE
status: Errata #3 detected.
action: To correct the issue backup existing encrypted datasets to new
	encrypted datasets and destroy the old ones.
   see: http://zfsonlinux.org/msg/ZFS-8000-ER
config:

	test           ONLINE
	  raidz1-0     ONLINE
	    vdev0      ONLINE
	    vdev1      ONLINE
	    vdev2      ONLINE
	    vdev3      ONLINE
</pre>

Import the pool and backup any existing encrypted datasets to new datasets.
To ensure the new datasets are re-encrypted, be sure to receive them below an
encryption root, then destroy the source dataset.
<pre>
# zfs create -o encryption=on -o keyformat=passphrase test/new_root
Enter passphrase:
Re-enter passphrase
# zfs send test/crypt1 | zfs receive test/new_root/crypt1
# zfs send test/crypt2 | zfs receive test/new_root/crypt2
# zfs destroy test/crypt1
# zfs destroy test/crypt2
</pre>

New datasets can be mounted read-write and used normally. The errata will be
cleared upon reimporting the pool and the alert will only be shown again if
another dataset is found with the errata. To ensure that all datasets are
on the new version reimport the pool, load all keys, mount all encrypted
datasets, and check <b>zpool status</b>.

<pre>
# zpool export test
# zpool import test
# zfs load-key -a
Enter passphrase for 'test/new_root': 
1 / 1 key(s) successfully loaded
# zfs mount -a
# zpool status -x
all pools are healthy
