<dd>Error
<dt><p><b>Severity</b>
<dd>Major
<dt><p><b>Description</b>
<dd>The ZFS pool was last accessed by another system
<dt><p><b>Automated Response</b>
<dd>No automated response will be taken.
<dt><p><b>Impact</b>
<dd>ZFS filesystems are not available
<dt><p><b>Suggested Action for System Administrator</b>
<dd>
<p>
The pool has been written to from another host, and was not cleanly exported
from the other system.  Actively importing a pool on multiple systems will
corrupt the pool and leave it in an unrecoverable state.  To determine which
system last accessed the pool, run the 'zpool import' command:</p>

<pre>
# zpool import
  pool: test
    id: 14702934086626715962
state:  ONLINE
status: The pool was last accessed by another system.
action: The pool can be imported using its name or numeric identifier and
        the '-f' flag.
   see: http://www.sun.com/msg/ZFS-8000-EY
config:

        test              ONLINE
          c0t0d0          ONLINE

# zpool import test
cannot import 'test': pool may be in use from other system, it was last
accessed by 'tank' (hostid: 0x1435718c) on Fri Mar  9 15:42:47 2007
use '-f' to import anyway
</pre>

<p>
If you are certain that the pool is not being actively accessed by another
system, then you can use the '-f' option to 'zpool import' to forcibly
import the pool.
</p>
	
<dt><p><b>Details</b>
<dd>The Message ID: <tt>ZFS-8000-EY</tt> indicates that
	    the pool cannot be imported as it was last accessed by another
	    system.  Take the documented action to resolve the problem.
