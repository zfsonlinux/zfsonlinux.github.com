<b>Corrupted pool metadata</b>
<p>
<dl>
<dt><p><b>Type</b>
<dd>Error
<dt><p><b>Severity</b>
<dd>Critical
<dt><p><b>Description</b>
<dd>The metadata required to open the pool is corrupt.
<dt><p><b>Automated Response</b>
<dd>No automated response will be taken.
<dt><p><b>Impact</b>
<dd>The pool is no longer available
<dt><p><b>Suggested Action for System Administrator</b>
<dd>
<p>Even though all the devices are available, the on-disk data
has been corrupted such that the pool cannot be opened.  If a recovery
action is presented, the pool can be returned to a usable state.
Otherwise, all data within the pool is lost, and the pool must be
destroyed and restored from an appropriate backup source.  ZFS
includes built-in metadata replication to prevent this from happening
even for unreplicated pools, but running in a replicated configuration
will decrease the chances of this happening in the future.</p>

<p>If this error is encountered during 'zpool import', see the
section below.  Otherwise, run 'zpool status -x' to determine which
pool is faulted and if a recovery option is available:</p>

<pre>
# zpool status -x
  pool: test
    id: 13783646421373024673
 state: FAULTED
status: The pool metadata is corrupted and cannot be opened.
action: Recovery is possible, but will result in some data loss.
        Returning the pool to its state as of Mon Sep 28 10:24:39 2009
        should correct the problem.  Approximately 59 seconds of data
        will have to be discarded, irreversibly.  Recovery can be
        attempted by executing 'zpool clear -F test'.  A scrub of the pool
        is strongly recommended following a successful recovery.
   see: http://www.sun.com/msg/ZFS-8000-72
config:

        NAME                  STATE     READ WRITE CKSUM
        test                  FAULTED      0     0     2  corrupted data
            c0t0d0            ONLINE       0     0     2
            c0t0d1            ONLINE       0     0     2
</pre>

<p>If recovery is unavailable, the recommended action will be:</p>

<pre>
action: Destroy the pool and restore from backup.
</pre>

<p>If this error is encountered during 'zpool import', and if no
recovery option is mentioned, the pool is unrecoverable and cannot be
imported.  The pool must be restored from an appropriate backup
source.  If a recovery option is available, the output from 'zpool
import' will look something like the following:</p>

<pre>
# zpool import share
cannot import 'share': I/O error
        Recovery is possible, but will result in some data loss.
        Returning the pool to its state as of Sun Sep 27 12:31:07 2009
        should correct the problem.  Approximately 53 seconds of data
        will have to be discarded, irreversibly.  Recovery can be
        attempted by executing 'zpool import -F share'.  A scrub of the pool
        is strongly recommended following a successful recovery.
</pre>

<p>Recovery actions are requested with the -F option to either
'zpool clear' or 'zpool import'.  Recovery will result in some data
loss, because it reverts the pool to an earlier state.  A dry-run
recovery check can be performed by adding the -n option, affirming if
recovery is possible without actually reverting the pool to its
earlier state.</p>

<dt><p><b>Details</b>
<dd>The Message ID: <tt>ZFS-8000-72</tt> indicates a pool was
	    unable to be opened due to a detected corruption in the pool
	    metadata.
