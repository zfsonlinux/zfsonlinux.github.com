<b>ZFS pool I/O failures</b>
<p>
<dl>
<dt><p><b>Type</b>
<dd>Error
<dt><p><b>Severity</b>
<dd>Major
<dt><p><b>Description</b>
<dd>The ZFS pool has experienced currently unrecoverable I/O failures.
<dt><p><b>Automated Response</b>
<dd>No automated response will be taken.
<dt><p><b>Impact</b>
<dd>Write I/Os cannot be serviced.
<dt><p><b>Suggested Action for System Administrator</b>
<dd>
<p>The pool has experienced I/O failures. Since the ZFS pool property 'failmode'
is set to 'continue', read I/Os will continue to be serviced, but write I/Os
are blocked.  See the zpool(8) manpage for more information on the 'failmode'
property.  Manual intervention is required for write I/Os to be serviced.
  You can see which devices are affected by running 'zpool status -x':</p>

<pre># zpool status -x
  pool: test
 state: FAULTED
status: There are I/O failures.
action: Make sure the affected devices are connected, then run 'zpool clear'.
   see: https://zfsonlinux.org/msg/ZFS-8000-HC
 scrub: none requested
config:

        NAME        STATE     READ WRITE CKSUM
        test        FAULTED      0    13     0  insufficient replicas
          sda9      FAULTED      0     7     0  experienced I/O failures
          sdb9      ONLINE       0     0     0

errors: 1 data errors, use '-v' for a list
</pre>

<p>After you have made sure the affected devices are connected, run 'zpool clear'
to allow write I/O to the pool again:
</p>

<pre># zpool clear test
</pre>

<p>If I/O failures continue to happen, then applications and commands  for the
pool may hang.  At this point, a reboot may be necessary to allow I/O to the
pool again.
</p>
<dt><p><b>Details</b>
<dd>The Message ID: <tt>ZFS-8000-JQ</tt> indicates
	    that the pool has experienced I/O failures. Take the documented action to resolve the problem.
