system where the pool was originally created, upgrade the current system
software to a more recent version, or destroy the pool and re-create it from
backup.</p>

<p>If this error is seen during import, the pool cannot be imported on the
current system.  The disks must be attached to the system which originally
created the pool, and imported there.</p>

<p>The list of currently supported versions can be displayed using 'zpool
upgrade -v'.</p>

<dt><p><b>Details</b>
<dd>The Message ID: <tt>ZFS-8000-A5</tt> indicates a
