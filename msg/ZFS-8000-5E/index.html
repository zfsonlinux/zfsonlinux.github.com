<h4>For an active pool</h4>

<p>If this error was encountered while running 'zpool import', please see
the section below.  Otherwise, run 'zpool status -x' to determine which pool
has experienced a failure:</p>

<pre>
# zpool status -x
  pool: test
 state: FAULTED
status: One or more devices could not be used because the the label is missing 
        or invalid.  There are insufficient replicas for the pool to continue
        functioning.
action: Destroy and re-create the pool from a backup source.
   see: http://zfsonlinux.org/msg/ZFS-8000-5E
 scrub: none requested
config:

        NAME                  STATE     READ WRITE CKSUM
        test                  FAULTED      0     0     0  insufficient replicas

errors: No known data errors
</pre>

<p>The device listed as FAULTED with 'corrupted data' cannot be opened due
to a corrupt label.  ZFS will be unable to use the pool, and all data within the
pool is irrevocably lost.  The pool must be destroyed and recreated from an
appropriate backup source.  Using replicated configurations will prevent this
from happening in the future.</p>

<h4>For an exported pool</h4>

<p>If this error is encountered during 'zpool import', the action is the
same.  The pool cannot be imported - all data is lost and must be restored from
an appropriate backup source.</p>
