<b>Missing top level device</b>
<p>
<dl>
<dt><p><b>Type</b>
<dd>Error
<dt><p><b>Severity</b>
<dd>Critical
<dt><p><b>Description</b>
<dd>One or more top level devices are missing.
<dt><p><b>Automated Response</b>
<dd>No automated response will be taken.
<dt><p><b>Impact</b>
<dd>The pool cannot be imported
<dt><p><b>Suggested Action for System Administrator</b>
<dd>
<p>Run 'zpool import' to list which pool cannot be imported:</p>

<pre>
# zpool import
  pool: test
    id: 13783646421373024673
 state: FAULTED
status: One or more devices are missing from the system.
action: The pool cannot be imported.  Attach the missing
	devices and try again.
   see: https://zfsonlinux.com/msg/ZFS-8000-6X
config:

        test              FAULTED   missing device
          c0t0d0          ONLINE

        Additional devices are known to be part of this pool, though their
        exact configuration cannot be determined.
</pre>

<p>ZFS attempts to store enough configuration data on the devices such
that the configuration is recoverable from any subset of devices.  In some
cases, particularly when an entire toplevel virtual device is not attached to
the system, ZFS will be unable to determine the complete configuration.  It will
always detect that these devices are missing, even if it cannot identify all of
the devices.</p>

<p>The pool cannot be imported until the unknown missing device is
attached to the system.  If the device has been made available in an alternate
location, use the '-d' option to 'zpool import' to search for devices in a
different directory.  If the missing device is unavailable, then the pool cannot
be imported.<p>

<dd>The Message ID: <tt>ZFS-8000-6X</tt> indicates one
	    or more top level devices are missing from the configuration.
