<B>spl_kmem_cache_expire</B> (uint)

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
Cache expiration is part of default Illumos cache behavior.  The idea is
that objects in magazines which have not been recently accessed should be
returned to the slabs periodically.  This is known as cache aging and
when enabled objects will be typically returned after 15 seconds.
<P>
On the other hand Linux slabs are designed to never move objects back to
the slabs unless there is memory pressure.  This is possible because under
Linux the cache will be notified when memory is low and objects can be
released.
<P>
By default only the Linux method is enabled.  It has been shown to improve
responsiveness on low memory systems and not negatively impact the performance
of systems with more memory.  This policy may be changed by setting the
<B>spl_kmem_cache_expire</B> bit mask as follows, both policies may be enabled
concurrently.
<P>
0x01 - Aging (Illumos), 0x02 - Low memory (Linux)
<P>
Default value: <B>0x02</B>
</DL>

<P>
<P>


<B>spl_kmem_cache_kmem_threads</B> (uint)

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
The number of threads created for the spl_kmem_cache task queue.  This task
queue is responsible for allocating new slabs for use by the kmem caches.
For the majority of systems and workloads only a small number of threads are
required.
<P>
Default value: <B>4</B>
</DL>

<P>
<P>


<B>spl_kmem_cache_reclaim</B> (uint)

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
When this is set it prevents Linux from being able to rapidly reclaim all the
memory held by the kmem caches.  This may be useful in circumstances where
it's preferable that Linux reclaim memory from some other subsystem first.
Setting this will increase the likelihood out of memory events on a memory
constrained system.
<P>
Default value: <B>0</B>
</DL>

<P>
<P>


<B>spl_kmem_cache_obj_per_slab</B> (uint)

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
The preferred number of objects per slab in the cache.   In general, a larger
value will increase the caches memory footprint while decreasing the time
required to perform an allocation.  Conversely, a smaller value will minimize
the footprint and improve cache reclaim time but individual allocations may
take longer.
<P>
Default value: <B>8</B>
</DL>

<P>
<P>


<B>spl_kmem_cache_obj_per_slab_min</B> (uint)

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
The minimum number of objects allowed per slab.  Normally slabs will contain
<B>spl_kmem_cache_obj_per_slab</B> objects but for caches that contain very
large objects it's desirable to only have a few, or even just one, object per
slab.
<P>
Default value: <B>1</B>
</DL>

<P>
<P>


<B>spl_kmem_cache_max_size</B> (uint)

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
The maximum size of a kmem cache slab in MiB.  This effectively limits
the maximum cache object size to <B>spl_kmem_cache_max_size</B> /
<B>spl_kmem_cache_obj_per_slab</B>.  Caches may not be created with
object sized larger than this limit.
<P>
Default value: <B>32 (64-bit) or 4 (32-bit)</B>
</DL>

<P>
<P>


<B>spl_kmem_cache_slab_limit</B> (uint)

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
For small objects the Linux slab allocator should be used to make the most
efficient use of the memory.  However, large objects are not supported by
the Linux slab and therefore the SPL implementation is preferred.  This
value is used to determine the cutoff between a small and large object.
<P>
Objects of <B>spl_kmem_cache_slab_limit</B> or smaller will be allocated
using the Linux slab allocator, large objects use the SPL allocator.  A
cutoff of 16K was determined to be optimal for architectures using 4K pages.
<P>
Default value: <B>16,384</B>
</DL>

<P>
<P>


<B>spl_kmem_cache_kmem_limit</B> (uint)

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
Depending on the size of a cache object it may be backed by kmalloc()'d
or vmalloc()'d memory.  This is because the size of the required allocation
greatly impacts the best way to allocate the memory.
<P>
When objects are small and only a small number of memory pages need to be
allocated, ideally just one, then kmalloc() is very efficient.  However,
when allocating multiple pages with kmalloc() it gets increasingly expensive
because the pages must be physically contiguous.
<P>
For this reason we shift to vmalloc() for slabs of large objects which
which removes the need for contiguous pages.  We cannot use vmalloc() in
all cases because there is significant locking overhead involved.  This
function takes a single global lock over the entire virtual address range
which serializes all allocations.  Using slightly different allocation
functions for small and large objects allows us to handle a wide range of
object sizes.
<P>
The <B>spl_kmem_cache_kmem_limit</B> value is used to determine this cutoff
size.  One quarter the PAGE_SIZE is used as the default value because
<B>spl_kmem_cache_obj_per_slab</B> defaults to 16.  This means that at
most we will need to allocate four contiguous pages.
<P>
Default value: <B>PAGE_SIZE/4</B>
</DL>

<P>
<P>


<B>spl_kmem_alloc_warn</B> (uint)

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
As a general rule kmem_alloc() allocations should be small, preferably
just a few pages since they must by physically contiguous.  Therefore, a
rate limited warning will be printed to the console for any kmem_alloc()
which exceeds a reasonable threshold.
<P>
The default warning threshold is set to eight pages but capped at 32K to
accommodate systems using large pages.  This value was selected to be small
enough to ensure the largest allocations are quickly noticed and fixed.
But large enough to avoid logging any warnings when a allocation size is
larger than optimal but not a serious concern.  Since this value is tunable,
developers are encouraged to set it lower when testing so any new largish
allocations are quickly caught.  These warnings may be disabled by setting
the threshold to zero.
<P>
Default value: <B>32,768</B>
</DL>

<P>
<P>


<B>spl_kmem_alloc_max</B> (uint)

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
Large kmem_alloc() allocations will fail if they exceed KMALLOC_MAX_SIZE.
Allocations which are marginally smaller than this limit may succeed but
should still be avoided due to the expense of locating a contiguous range
of free pages.  Therefore, a maximum kmem size with reasonable safely
margin of 4x is set.  Kmem_alloc() allocations larger than this maximum
will quickly fail.  Vmem_alloc() allocations less than or equal to this
value will use kmalloc(), but shift to vmalloc() when exceeding this value.
<P>
Default value: <B>KMALLOC_MAX_SIZE/4</B>
</DL>

<P>
<P>


<B>spl_kmem_cache_magazine_size</B> (uint)

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
Cache magazines are an optimization designed to minimize the cost of
allocating memory.  They do this by keeping a per-cpu cache of recently
freed objects, which can then be reallocated without taking a lock. This
can improve performance on highly contended caches.  However, because
objects in magazines will prevent otherwise empty slabs from being
immediately released this may not be ideal for low memory machines.
<P>
For this reason <B>spl_kmem_cache_magazine_size</B> can be used to set a
maximum magazine size.  When this value is set to 0 the magazine size will
be automatically determined based on the object size.  Otherwise magazines
will be limited to 2-256 objects per magazine (i.e per cpu).  Magazines
may never be entirely disabled in this implementation.
<P>
Default value: <B>0</B>
</DL>

<P>
<P>


<B>spl_hostid</B> (ulong)

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
The system hostid, when set this can be used to uniquely identify a system.
By default this value is set to zero which indicates the hostid is disabled.
It can be explicitly enabled by placing a unique non-zero value in
<B>/etc/hostid/</B>.
<P>
Default value: <B>0</B>
</DL>

<P>
<P>


<B>spl_hostid_path</B> (charp)

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
The expected path to locate the system hostid when specified.  This value
may be overridden for non-standard configurations.
<P>
Default value: <B>/etc/hostid</B>
</DL>

<P>
<P>


<B>spl_panic_halt</B> (uint)

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
Cause a kernel panic on assertion failures. When not enabled, the thread is 
halted to facilitate further debugging.
<P>
Set to a non-zero value to enable.
<P>
Default value: <B>0</B>
</DL>

<P>
<P>


<B>spl_taskq_kick</B> (uint)

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
Kick stuck taskq to spawn threads. When writing a non-zero value to it, it will
scan all the taskqs. If any of them have a pending task more than 5 seconds old,
it will kick it to spawn more threads. This can be used if you find a rare
deadlock occurs because one or more taskqs didn't spawn a thread when it should.
<P>
Default value: <B>0</B>
</DL>

<P>
<P>


<B>spl_taskq_thread_bind</B> (int)

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
Bind taskq threads to specific CPUs.  When enabled all taskq threads will
be distributed evenly  over the available CPUs.  By default, this behavior
is disabled to allow the Linux scheduler the maximum flexibility to determine
where a thread should run.
<P>
Default value: <B>0</B>
</DL>

<P>
<P>


<B>spl_taskq_thread_dynamic</B> (int)

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
Allow dynamic taskqs.  When enabled taskqs which set the TASKQ_DYNAMIC flag
will by default create only a single thread.  New threads will be created on
demand up to a maximum allowed number to facilitate the completion of
outstanding tasks.  Threads which are no longer needed will be promptly
destroyed.  By default this behavior is enabled but it can be disabled to
aid performance analysis or troubleshooting.
<P>
Default value: <B>1</B>
</DL>

<P>
<P>


<B>spl_taskq_thread_priority</B> (int)

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
Allow newly created taskq threads to set a non-default scheduler priority.
When enabled the priority specified when a taskq is created will be applied
to all threads created by that taskq.  When disabled all threads will use
the default Linux kernel thread priority.  By default, this behavior is
enabled.
<P>
Default value: <B>1</B>
</DL>

<P>
<P>


<B>spl_taskq_thread_sequential</B> (int)

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
The number of items a taskq worker thread must handle without interruption
before requesting a new worker thread be spawned.  This is used to control
how quickly taskqs ramp up the number of threads processing the queue.
Because Linux thread creation and destruction are relatively inexpensive a
small default value has been selected.  This means that normally threads will
be created aggressively which is desirable.  Increasing this value will
result in a slower thread creation rate which may be preferable for some
configurations.
<P>
Default value: <B>4</B>
</DL>

<P>
<P>


<B>spl_max_show_tasks</B> (uint)

<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
The maximum number of tasks per pending list in each taskq shown in
/proc/spl/{taskq,taskq-all}. Write 0 to turn off the limit. The proc file will
walk the lists with lock held, reading it could cause a lock up if the list
grow too large without limiting the output. &quot;(truncated)&quot; will be shown if the
list is larger than the limit.
<P>
Default value: <B>512</B>
