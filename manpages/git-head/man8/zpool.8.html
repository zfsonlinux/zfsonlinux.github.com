<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

The
<B></B>


command configures ZFS storage pools.
A storage pool is a collection of devices that provides physical storage and
data replication for ZFS datasets.
All datasets within a storage pool share the same space.
See
<A HREF="../man8/zfs.8.html">zfs</A>(8)


for information on managing datasets.
<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Virtual Devices (vdevs)</H3>

A &quot;virtual device&quot; describes a single device or a collection of devices
organized according to certain performance and fault characteristics.
The following virtual devices are supported:
<DL COMPACT>
<P>

<DT><B>disk</B>


<DD>
A block device, typically located under
/dev

 
ZFS can use individual slices or partitions, though the recommended mode of
operation is to use whole disks.
A disk can be specified by a full path, or it can be a shorthand name
Po the relative portion of the path under

/dev

Pc .

A whole disk can be specified by omitting the slice or partition designation.
For example,
sda

is equivalent to
/dev/sda

 
When given a whole disk, ZFS automatically labels the disk, if necessary.
<DT><B>file</B>


<DD>
A regular file.
The use of files as a backing store is strongly discouraged.
It is designed primarily for experimental purposes, as the fault tolerance of a
file is only as good as the file system of which it is a part.
A file must be specified by a full path.
<DT><B>mirror</B>


<DD>
A mirror of two or more devices.
Data is replicated in an identical fashion across all components of a mirror.
A mirror with N disks of size X can hold X bytes and can withstand (N-1) devices
failing before data integrity is compromised.
<DT><B>raidz , raidz1 , raidz2 , raidz3</B>


<DD>
A variation on RAID-5 that allows for better distribution of parity and
eliminates the RAID-5
Qq write hole

(in which data and parity become inconsistent after a power loss)

 
Data and parity is striped across all disks within a raidz group.
<P>

A raidz group can have single-, double-, or triple-parity, meaning that the
raidz group can sustain one, two, or three failures, respectively, without
losing any data.
The
<B>raidz1</B>

vdev type specifies a single-parity raidz group; the
<B>raidz2</B>

vdev type specifies a double-parity raidz group; and the
<B>raidz3</B>

vdev type specifies a triple-parity raidz group.
The
<B>raidz</B>

vdev type is an alias for
<B>raidz1</B>

 
<P>

A raidz group with N disks of size X with P parity disks can hold approximately
(N-P)*X bytes and can withstand P device(s) failing before data integrity is
compromised.
The minimum number of devices in a raidz group is one more than the number of
parity disks.
The recommended number is between 3 and 9 to help increase performance.
<DT><B>spare</B>


<DD>
A special pseudo-vdev which keeps track of available hot spares for a pool.
For more information, see the
Sx Hot Spares

section.
<DT><B>log</B>


<DD>
A separate intent log device.
If more than one log device is specified, then writes are load-balanced between
devices.
Log devices can be mirrored.
However, raidz vdev types are not supported for the intent log.
For more information, see the
Sx Intent Log

section.
<DT><B>dedup</B>


<DD>
A device dedicated solely for allocating dedup data.
The redundancy of this device should match the redundancy of the other normal
devices in the pool. If more than one dedup device is specified, then
allocations are load-balanced between devices.
<DT><B>special</B>


<DD>
A device dedicated solely for allocating various kinds of internal metadata,
and optionally small file data.
The redundancy of this device should match the redundancy of the other normal
devices in the pool. If more than one special device is specified, then
allocations are load-balanced between devices.
<P>

For more information on special allocations, see the
Sx Special Allocation Class

section.
<DT><B>cache</B>


<DD>
A device used to cache storage pool data.
A cache device cannot be configured as a mirror or raidz group.
For more information, see the
Sx Cache Devices

section.
</DL>
<P>

<P>

Virtual devices cannot be nested, so a mirror or raidz virtual device can only
contain files or disks.
Mirrors of mirrors
(or other combinations)

are not allowed.
<P>

A pool can have any number of virtual devices at the top of the configuration
Po known as

Qq root vdevs

Pc .

Data is dynamically distributed across all top-level devices to balance data
among devices.
As new virtual devices are added, ZFS automatically places data on the newly
available devices.
<P>

Virtual devices are specified one at a time on the command line, separated by
whitespace.
The keywords
<B>mirror</B>

and
<B>raidz</B>

are used to distinguish where a group ends and another begins.
For example, the following creates two root vdevs, each a mirror of two disks:

<PRE>
# zpool create mypool mirror sda sdb mirror sdc sdd
</PRE>

<A NAME="lbAF">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Device Failure and Recovery</H3>

ZFS supports a rich set of mechanisms for handling device failure and data
corruption.
All metadata and data is checksummed, and ZFS automatically repairs bad data
from a good copy when corruption is detected.
<P>

In order to take advantage of these features, a pool must make use of some form
of redundancy, using either mirrored or raidz groups.
While ZFS supports running in a non-redundant configuration, where each root
vdev is simply a disk or file, this is strongly discouraged.
A single case of bit corruption can render some or all of your data unavailable.
<P>

A pool's health status is described by one of three states: online, degraded,
or faulted.
An online pool has all devices operating normally.
A degraded pool is one in which one or more devices have failed, but the data is
still available due to a redundant configuration.
A faulted pool has corrupted metadata, or one or more faulted devices, and
insufficient replicas to continue functioning.
<P>

The health of the top-level vdev, such as mirror or raidz device, is
potentially impacted by the state of its associated vdevs, or component
devices.
A top-level vdev or component device is in one of the following states:
<DL COMPACT>
<P>

<DT><B>DEGRADED</B>


<DD>
One or more top-level vdevs is in the degraded state because one or more
component devices are offline.
Sufficient replicas exist to continue functioning.
<P>

One or more component devices is in the degraded or faulted state, but
sufficient replicas exist to continue functioning.
The underlying conditions are as follows:
<UL><P>

<LI>

The number of checksum errors exceeds acceptable levels and the device is
degraded as an indication that something may be wrong.
ZFS continues to use the device as necessary.
<LI>

The number of I/O errors exceeds acceptable levels.
The device could not be marked as faulted because there are insufficient
replicas to continue functioning.
</UL><P>

<DT><B>FAULTED</B>


<DD>
One or more top-level vdevs is in the faulted state because one or more
component devices are offline.
Insufficient replicas exist to continue functioning.
<P>

One or more component devices is in the faulted state, and insufficient
replicas exist to continue functioning.
The underlying conditions are as follows:
<UL><P>

<LI>

The device could be opened, but the contents did not match expected values.
<LI>

The number of I/O errors exceeds acceptable levels and the device is faulted to
prevent further use of the device.
</UL><P>

<DT><B>OFFLINE</B>


<DD>
The device was explicitly taken offline by the
<B>zpool offline</B>



command.
<DT><B>ONLINE</B>


<DD>
The device is online and functioning.
<DT><B>REMOVED</B>


<DD>
The device was physically removed while the system was running.
Device removal detection is hardware-dependent and may not be supported on all
platforms.
<DT><B>UNAVAIL</B>


<DD>
The device could not be opened.
If a pool is imported when a device was unavailable, then the device will be
identified by a unique identifier instead of its path since the path was never
correct in the first place.
</DL>
<P>

<P>

If a device is removed and later re-attached to the system, ZFS attempts
to put the device online automatically.
Device attach detection is hardware-dependent and might not be supported on all
platforms.
<A NAME="lbAG">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Hot Spares</H3>

ZFS allows devices to be associated with pools as
Qq hot spares .

These devices are not actively used in the pool, but when an active device
fails, it is automatically replaced by a hot spare.
To create a pool with hot spares, specify a
<B>spare</B>

vdev with any number of devices.
For example,

<PRE>
# zpool create pool mirror sda sdb spare sdc sdd
</PRE>

<P>

Spares can be shared across multiple pools, and can be added with the
<B>zpool add</B>



command and removed with the
<B>zpool remove</B>



command.
Once a spare replacement is initiated, a new
<B>spare</B>

vdev is created within the configuration that will remain there until the
original device is replaced.
At this point, the hot spare becomes available again if another device fails.
<P>

If a pool has a shared spare that is currently being used, the pool can not be
exported since other pools may use this shared spare, which may lead to
potential data corruption.
<P>

An in-progress spare replacement can be cancelled by detaching the hot spare.
If the original faulted device is detached, then the hot spare assumes its
place in the configuration, and is removed from the spare list of all active
pools.
<P>

Spares cannot replace log devices.
<A NAME="lbAH">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Intent Log</H3>

The ZFS Intent Log (ZIL) satisfies POSIX requirements for synchronous
transactions.
For instance, databases often require their transactions to be on stable storage
devices when returning from a system call.
NFS and other applications can also use
<A HREF="../man2/fsync.2.html">fsync</A>(2)


to ensure data stability.
By default, the intent log is allocated from blocks within the main pool.
However, it might be possible to get better performance using separate intent
log devices such as NVRAM or a dedicated disk.
For example:

<PRE>
# zpool create pool sda sdb log sdc
</PRE>

<P>

Multiple log devices can also be specified, and they can be mirrored.
See the
Sx EXAMPLES

section for an example of mirroring multiple log devices.
<P>

Log devices can be added, replaced, attached, detached and removed.  In
addition, log devices are imported and exported as part of the pool
that contains them.
Mirrored devices can be removed by specifying the top-level mirror vdev.
<A NAME="lbAI">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Cache Devices</H3>

Devices can be added to a storage pool as
Qq cache devices .

These devices provide an additional layer of caching between main memory and
disk.
For read-heavy workloads, where the working set size is much larger than what
can be cached in main memory, using cache devices allow much more of this
working set to be served from low latency media.
Using cache devices provides the greatest performance improvement for random
read-workloads of mostly static content.
<P>

To create a pool with cache devices, specify a
<B>cache</B>

vdev with any number of devices.
For example:

<PRE>
# zpool create pool sda sdb cache sdc sdd
</PRE>

<P>

Cache devices cannot be mirrored or part of a raidz configuration.
If a read error is encountered on a cache device, that read I/O is reissued to
the original storage pool device, which might be part of a mirrored or raidz
configuration.
<P>

The content of the cache devices is considered volatile, as is the case with
other system caches.
<A NAME="lbAJ">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Pool checkpoint</H3>

Before starting critical procedures that include destructive actions (e.g
<B>zfs destroy</B>



), an administrator can checkpoint the pool's state and in the case of a
mistake or failure, rewind the entire pool back to the checkpoint.
Otherwise, the checkpoint can be discarded when the procedure has completed
successfully.
<P>

A pool checkpoint can be thought of as a pool-wide snapshot and should be used
with care as it contains every part of the pool's state, from properties to vdev
configuration.
Thus, while a pool has a checkpoint certain operations are not allowed.
Specifically, vdev removal/attach/detach, mirror splitting, and
changing the pool's guid.
Adding a new vdev is supported but in the case of a rewind it will have to be
added again.
Finally, users of this feature should keep in mind that scrubs in a pool that
has a checkpoint do not repair checkpointed data.
<P>

To create a checkpoint for a pool:

<PRE>
# zpool checkpoint pool
</PRE>

<P>

To later rewind to its checkpointed state, you need to first export it and
then rewind it during import:

<PRE>
# zpool export pool
# zpool import --rewind-to-checkpoint pool
</PRE>

<P>

To discard the checkpoint from a pool:

<PRE>
# zpool checkpoint -d pool
</PRE>

<P>

Dataset reservations (controlled by the
<B>reservation</B>

or
<B>refreservation</B>

zfs properties) may be unenforceable while a checkpoint exists, because the
checkpoint is allowed to consume the dataset's reservation.
Finally, data that is part of the checkpoint but has been freed in the
current state of the pool won't be scanned during a scrub.
<A NAME="lbAK">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Special Allocation Class</H3>

The allocations in the special class are dedicated to specific block types.
By default this includes all metadata, the indirect blocks of user data, and
any dedup data.  The class can also be provisioned to accept a limited
percentage of small file data blocks.
<P>

A pool must always have at least one general (non-specified) vdev before
other devices can be assigned to the special class. If the special class
becomes full, then allocations intended for it will spill back into the
normal class.
<P>

Dedup data can be excluded from the special class by setting the
<B>zfs_ddt_data_is_special</B>

zfs module parameter to false (0).
<P>

Inclusion of small file blocks in the special class is opt-in. Each dataset
can control the size of small file blocks allowed in the special class by
setting the
<B>special_small_blocks</B>

dataset property. It defaults to zero so you must opt-in by setting it to a
non-zero value. See
<A HREF="../man8/zfs.8.html">zfs</A>(8)


for more info on setting this property.
<A NAME="lbAL">&nbsp;</A>
<H3>Properties</H3>

Each pool has several properties associated with it.
Some properties are read-only statistics while others are configurable and
change the behavior of the pool.
<P>

The following are read-only properties:
<DL COMPACT>
<P>

<DT><B>allocated</B>


<DD>
Amount of storage used within the pool.
<DT><B>capacity</B>


<DD>
Percentage of pool space used.
This property can also be referred to by its shortened column name,
<B>cap</B>

 
<DT><B>expandsize</B>


<DD>
Amount of uninitialized space within the pool or device that can be used to
increase the total capacity of the pool.
Uninitialized space consists of any space on an EFI labeled vdev which has not
been brought online
Po e.g, using

<B>zpool online -e</B>





Pc .

This space occurs when a LUN is dynamically expanded.
<DT><B>fragmentation</B>


<DD>
The amount of fragmentation in the pool.
<DT><B>free</B>


<DD>
The amount of free space available in the pool.
<DT><B>freeing</B>


<DD>
After a file system or snapshot is destroyed, the space it was using is
returned to the pool asynchronously.
<B>freeing</B>

is the amount of space remaining to be reclaimed.
Over time
<B>freeing</B>

will decrease while
<B>free</B>

increases.
<DT><B>health</B>


<DD>
The current health of the pool.
Health can be one of
<B>ONLINE , DEGRADED , FAULTED , OFFLINE, REMOVED , UNAVAIL</B>

 
<DT><B>guid</B>


<DD>
A unique identifier for the pool.
<DT><B>load_guid</B>


<DD>
A unique identifier for the pool.
Unlike the
<B>guid</B>

property, this identifier is generated every time we load the pool (e.g. does
not persist across imports/exports) and never changes while the pool is loaded
(even if a
<B>reguid</B>

operation takes place).
<DT><B>size</B>


<DD>
Total size of the storage pool.
<DT><B>unsupported@ </B><I>feature_guid</I>






<DD>
Information about unsupported features that are enabled on the pool.
See
zpool-features5


for details.
</DL>
<P>

<P>

The space usage properties report actual physical space available to the
storage pool.
The physical space can be different from the total amount of space that any
contained datasets can actually use.
The amount of space used in a raidz configuration depends on the characteristics
of the data being written.
In addition, ZFS reserves some space for internal accounting that the
<A HREF="../man8/zfs.8.html">zfs</A>(8)


command takes into account, but the
<B></B>


command does not.
For non-full pools of a reasonable size, these effects should be invisible.
For small pools, or pools that are close to being completely full, these
discrepancies may become more noticeable.
<P>

The following property can be set at creation time and import time:
<DL COMPACT>
<P>

<DT><B>altroot</B>


<DD>
Alternate root directory.
If set, this directory is prepended to any mount points within the pool.
This can be used when examining an unknown pool where the mount points cannot be
trusted, or in an alternate boot environment, where the typical paths are not
valid.
<B>altroot</B>

is not a persistent property.
It is valid only while the system is up.
Setting
<B>altroot</B>

defaults to using
<B>cachefile = none</B>







 
though this may be overridden using an explicit setting.
</DL>
<P>

<P>

The following property can be set only at import time:
<DL COMPACT>
<P>

<DT><B>readonly = on | off</B>














<DD>
If set to
<B>on</B>

 
the pool will be imported in read-only mode.
This property can also be referred to by its shortened column name,
<B>rdonly</B>

 
</DL>
<P>

<P>

The following properties can be set at creation time and import time, and later
changed with the
<B>zpool set</B>



command:
<DL COMPACT>
<P>

<DT><B>ashift = ashift</B>








<DD>
Pool sector size exponent, to the power of
<B>2</B>

(internally referred to as
<B>ashift</B>

). Values from 9 to 16, inclusive, are valid; also, the special
value 0 (the default) means to auto-detect using the kernel's block
layer and a ZFS internal exception list. I/O operations will be aligned
to the specified size boundaries. Additionally, the minimum (disk)
write size will be set to the specified size, so this represents a
space vs. performance trade-off. For optimal performance, the pool
sector size should be greater than or equal to the sector size of the
underlying disks. The typical case for setting this property is when
performance is important and the underlying disks use 4KiB sectors but
report 512B sectors to the OS (for compatibility reasons); in that
case, set
<B>ashift=12</B>

(which is 1&lt;&lt;12 = 4096). When set, this property is
used as the default hint value in subsequent vdev operations (add,
attach and replace). Changing this value will not modify any existing
vdev, not even on disk replacement; however it can be used, for
instance, to replace a dying 512B sectors disk with a newer 4KiB
sectors device: this will probably result in bad performance but at the
same time could prevent loss of data.
<DT><B>autoexpand = on | off</B>














<DD>
Controls automatic pool expansion when the underlying LUN is grown.
If set to
<B>on</B>

 
the pool will be resized according to the size of the expanded device.
If the device is part of a mirror or raidz then all devices within that
mirror/raidz group must be expanded before the new space is made available to
the pool.
The default behavior is
<B>off</B>

 
This property can also be referred to by its shortened column name,
<B>expand</B>

 
<DT><B>autoreplace = on | off</B>














<DD>
Controls automatic device replacement.
If set to
<B>off</B>

 
device replacement must be initiated by the administrator by using the
<B>zpool replace</B>



command.
If set to
<B>on</B>

 
any new device, found in the same physical location as a device that previously
belonged to the pool, is automatically formatted and replaced.
The default behavior is
<B>off</B>

 
This property can also be referred to by its shortened column name,
<B>replace</B>

 
Autoreplace can also be used with virtual disks (like device
mapper) provided that you use the /dev/disk/by-vdev paths setup by
vdev_id.conf. See the
vdev_id8


man page for more details.
Autoreplace and autoonline require the ZFS Event Daemon be configured and
running.  See the
<A HREF="../man8/zed.8.html">zed</A>(8)


man page for more details.
<DT><B>bootfs = (unset) | </B><I>pool </I><B>/ </B><I>dataset</I>




















<DD>
Identifies the default bootable dataset for the root pool. This property is
expected to be set mainly by the installation and upgrade programs.
Not all Linux distribution boot processes use the bootfs property.
<DT><B>cachefile = </B><I>path </I><B>| none</B>














<DD>
Controls the location of where the pool configuration is cached.
Discovering all pools on system startup requires a cached copy of the
configuration data that is stored on the root file system.
All pools in this cache are automatically imported when the system boots.
Some environments, such as install and clustering, need to cache this
information in a different location so that pools are not automatically
imported.
Setting this property caches the pool configuration in a different location that
can later be imported with
<B>zpool import -c</B>





 
Setting it to the special value
<B>none</B>

creates a temporary pool that is never cached, and the special value
Qq (empty string)



uses the default location.
<P>

Multiple pools can share the same cache file.
Because the kernel destroys and recreates this file when pools are added and
removed, care should be taken when attempting to access this file.
When the last pool using a
<B>cachefile</B>

is exported or destroyed, the file will be empty.
<DT><B>comment = </B><I>text</I>








<DD>
A text string consisting of printable ASCII characters that will be stored
such that it is available even if the pool becomes faulted.
An administrator can provide additional information about a pool using this
property.
<DT><B>dedupditto = </B><I>number</I>








<DD>
Threshold for the number of block ditto copies.
If the reference count for a deduplicated block increases above this number, a
new ditto copy of this block is automatically stored.
The default setting is
<B>0</B>

which causes no ditto copies to be created for deduplicated blocks.
The minimum legal nonzero setting is
<B>100</B>

 
<DT><B>delegation = on | off</B>














<DD>
Controls whether a non-privileged user is granted access based on the dataset
permissions defined on the dataset.
See
<A HREF="../man8/zfs.8.html">zfs</A>(8)


for more information on ZFS delegated administration.
<DT><B>failmode = wait | continue | panic</B>




















<DD>
Controls the system behavior in the event of catastrophic pool failure.
This condition is typically a result of a loss of connectivity to the underlying
storage device(s) or a failure of all devices within the pool.
The behavior of such an event is determined as follows:
<DL COMPACT>
<P>

<DT><B>wait</B>


<DD>
Blocks all I/O access until the device connectivity is recovered and the errors
are cleared.
This is the default behavior.
<DT><B>continue</B>


<DD>
Returns
Er EIO

to any new write I/O requests but allows reads to any of the remaining healthy
devices.
Any write requests that have yet to be committed to disk would be blocked.
<DT><B>panic</B>


<DD>
Prints out a message to the console and generates a system crash dump.
</DL>
<P>

<DT><B>feature@ </B><I>feature_name </I><B>= enabled</B>












<DD>
The value of this property is the current state of
<I>feature_name</I>

 
The only valid value when setting this property is
<B>enabled</B>

which moves
<I>feature_name</I>

to the enabled state.
See

for details on feature states.
<DT><B>listsnapshots = on | off</B>














<DD>
Controls whether information about snapshots associated with this pool is
output when
<B>zfs list</B>



is run without the
-<B>t</B>

option.
The default value is
<B>off</B>

 
This property can also be referred to by its shortened name,
<B>listsnaps</B>

 
<DT><B>multihost = on | off</B>














<DD>
Controls whether a pool activity check should be performed during
<B>zpool import</B>



 
When a pool is determined to be active it cannot be imported, even with the
-<B>f</B>

option.  This property is intended to be used in failover configurations
where multiple hosts have access to a pool on shared storage.  When this
property is on, periodic writes to storage occur to show the pool is in use.
See
<B>zfs_multihost_interval</B>

in the
zfs-module-parameters5


man page.  In order to enable this property each host must set a unique hostid.

<DT><B>version = </B><I>version</I>








<DD>
The current on-disk version of the pool.
This can be increased, but never decreased.
The preferred method of updating pools is with the

command, though this property can be used when a specific version is needed for
backwards compatibility.
Once feature flags are enabled on a pool this property will no longer have a

<P>

The command verifies that each device specified is accessible and not currently
in use by another subsystem.
There are some uses, such as being currently mounted, or specified as the
dedicated dump device, that prevents a device from ever being used by ZFS.
Other uses, such as having a preexisting UFS file system, can be overridden with
the
-<B>f</B>

option.
<P>

The command also checks that the replication strategy for the pool is
consistent.
An attempt to combine redundant and non-redundant storage in a single pool, or
to mix disks and files, results in an error unless
-<B>f</B>

is specified.
The use of differently sized devices within a single raidz or mirror group is
also flagged as an error unless

<DD>

<DD>Begins a scrub or resumes a paused scrub.
The scrub examines all data in the specified pools to verify that it checksums
correctly.
For replicated

devices, ZFS automatically repairs any damage discovered during the scrub.
The
<B>zpool status</B>



command reports the progress of the scrub and summarizes the results of the
scrub upon completion.
<P>

Scrubbing and resilvering are very similar operations.
The difference is that resilvering only examines data that ZFS knows to be out
of date
Po for example, when attaching a new device to a mirror or replacing an existing

device
Pc ,

whereas scrubbing examines all data to discover silent errors due to hardware
faults or disk failure.
<P>

Because scrubbing and resilvering are I/O-intensive operations, ZFS only allows
one at a time.
If a scrub is paused, the
<B>zpool scrub</B>



resumes it.
If a resilver is in progress, ZFS does not allow a scrub to be started until the
resilver completes.
