packages for regular installations.

<p>The following instructions assume you are building from an official release
tarball or directly from the git repository.  Most users should not need to
do this and should preferentially use the packages provided by their
distribution.  As a general rule the distribution packages will be more
tightly integrated, widely tested, and better supported.  However, if your
distribution of choice doesn't provide packages then this may be your best
option.</p>

<p>The first thing to be aware of is that the build system is capable of
generating two different types of kernel packages.  Which type of package
you choose depends on your expected environment.</p>

<ul>
<li><b>DKMS</b> packages contain only the source code and scripts for
rebuilding the kernel modules.  When the DKMS package is installed kernel
modules will be built for all available kernels.  Additionally, when the
kernel is upgraded new kernels modules will be automatically built for that
kernel.  This is particularly convenient for desktop systems which receive
frequent kernel updates.  The downside is that because the DKMS packages
build the kernel modules from source a full development environment is
required which may not be appropriate for large deployments.</li>

<li><b>KMOD</b> packages are binary kernel modules which are compiled
against a specific version of the kernel.  This means that if you update
the kernel you <i>must</i> recompile and install a new KMOD package.
If you don't frequently update your kernel or if your managing a large number
of systems then KMOD packages are a good choice.</li>
</ul>

<p>By default the build system will generate user packages and both DKMS
and KMOD packages.  The user packages can be used with either set of kernel
packages and do not need to be rebuilt when the kernel is updated.  You
can also streamline the build process by building only the DKMS or KMOD
packages as shown below.</p>

<p>Be aware that when building directly from a git repository you must first
run the <i>autogen.sh</i> script to create the <i>configure</i> script.</p>

<p>Building KMOD packages is similar to building DKMS packages.  The major
difference is that when building a KMOD a specific Linux kernel must be
specified.  At <i>configure</i> time the build system will make an educated
guess as to which kernel you want to build against.  However, if <i>configure</i>
is unable to locate your kernel development headers, or you want to build
against a different kernel, you can specify the exact path with the
<i>--with-linux</i> and <i>--with-linux-obj</i> options.</p>

<p>That's it!  Once the packages are successfully installed you can use it just
just like you would in Solaris, Illumos, or FreeBSD.</p>
